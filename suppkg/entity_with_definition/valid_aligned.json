Neomycin is an antibiotic complex consisting of 3 components: the two isomeric components B and C are the active components, and neomycin A is the minor component. Neomycin irreversibly binds to the 16S rRNA and S12 protein of the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit. As a result, this agent interferes with the assembly of initiation complex between mRNA and the bacterial ribosome, thereby inhibiting the initiation of protein synthesis. In addition, neomycin induces misreading of the mRNA template and causes translational frameshift, thereby results in premature termination. This eventually leads to bacterial cell death.",

Definition: A morpholine-based inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family of proteins, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, the PI3K/BET inhibitor LY294002 specifically targets and binds to both PI3K and the acetylated lysine recognition motifs in the bromodomains of BET proteins. Inhibition of PI3K activity inhibits the PI3K/AKT kinase signaling pathway. This may result in inhibition of growth and survival for tumor cells in which the PI3K-mediated signaling pathway is overactivated. Inhibition of BET proteins prevents their interaction with acetylated histones, disrupts chromatin remodeling and inhibits the expression of oncogenic drivers that are important for cell proliferation and survival, which together may lead to an inhibition of proliferation in BET-overexpressing tumor cells. Activation of the PI3K signaling pathway is frequently associated with tumorigenesis. BET proteins, comprised of BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT, are transcriptional regulators and play an important role during development and cellular growth. In tumor cells, BET proteins play a key role in the regulation of oncogene transcription and tumor cell proliferation.",

Definition: DNA Excision Repair Protein ERCC-4, encoded by the ERCC4 gene, is a DNA repair protein. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) involves incision of a DNA strand on each side of a lesion. The two incisions made during NER are catalyzed by separate DNA endonucleases. A tight protein complex formed between ERCC4 and ERCC1 acts as a structure-specific endonuclease for the 5-prime incision during repair. Without DNA damage, this complex moves freely through the nucleus. Ultraviolet light-induced DNA damage causes a transient immobilization of ERCC4/ERCC1 due to engagement of the complex in a single repair event after assembly of individual nucleotide excision repair factors at sites of DNA damage in a distributive fashion. Causative mutations in the ERCC4 gene and strongly reduced levels of encoded protein can be identified in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum type F. (From OMIM and NCI)",

Definition: The hydrochloride salt form of fingolimod, an orally available derivate of myriocin and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1, S1P1) modulator, with potential anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating activities. Upon oral administration, fingolimod, as a structural analogue of sphingosine, selectively targets and binds to S1PR1 on lymphocytes and causes transient receptor activation followed by S1PR1 internalization and degradation. This results in the sequestration of lymphocytes in lymph nodes. By preventing egress of lymphocytes. fingolimod reduces both the amount of circulating peripheral lymphocytes and the infiltration of lymphocytes into target tissues. This prevents a lymphocyte-mediated immune response and may reduce inflammation. S1PR1, a G-protein coupled receptor, plays a key role in lymphocyte migration from lymphoid tissues. Fingolimod also shifts macrophages to an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, and modulates their proliferation, morphology, and cytokine release via inhibition of the transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 7 (TRPM7).",

Definition: A synthetic N-acetyl derivative and prodrug of the endogenous amino acid L-cysteine, a precursor of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH), with mucolytic, antioxidant, and potential cytoprotective, cancer-preventive, and anti-inflammatory activities. Upon administration, acetylcysteine exerts its mucolytic activity by reducing disulfide bonds in mucoproteins, resulting in liquification of mucus and reducing its viscosity. It is also used for the treatment of acetaminophen overdose as it can restore the depleted GSH reserves in the hepatocytes during the process of detoxification. The antioxidant activity is attributed to the ability of GSH to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby preventing ROS-mediated cell damage, decreasing oxidative stress, protecting cells against the damaging effects of free radicals and preventing apoptosis in these cells. In addition, this may inhibit tumor cell proliferation, progression and survival, in susceptible tumor cells that rely on ROS-mediated signaling for their proliferation and malignant behavior. Under certain circumstances, acetylcysteine is able to induce apoptosis in susceptible cells, including certain tumor cells, via the intrinsic mitochondria-dependent pathway but not involving endoplasmic reticulum stress. Also, acetylcysteine may also be able to degrade Notch2, thereby preventing proliferation, migration, and invasion in Notch2-overexpressing glioblastoma cells. In addition, acetylcysteine may inhibit viral stimulation by reactive oxygen intermediates, thereby producing antiviral activity in HIV patients. Acetylcysteine also possesses anti-inflammatory activity through modulation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) pathway and the modulation of cytokine synthesis.",

Definition: <h3>What is asthma? </h3> <p><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/asthma.html\">Asthma</a> is a chronic (long-term) lung disease. It affects your airways, the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. When you have asthma, your airways can become inflamed and narrowed. This can cause wheezing, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/cough.html\">coughing</a>, and tightness in your chest. When these symptoms get worse than usual, it is called an asthma attack or flare-up.</p> <h3>How does asthma affect children? </h3> <p>Asthma often starts during childhood, usually before age 5. Many children have asthma - it is the most common chronic disease of childhood. It can cause children to miss school and end up in the hospital. But treatments can help manage asthma.</p> <h3>What causes asthma in children?</h3> <p>The exact cause of asthma is unknown. Genetics and environment likely play a role in which children get asthma.</p> <p>An asthma attack can happen when your child is exposed to an asthma trigger. An asthma trigger is something that can set off or worsen asthma symptoms. Different triggers can cause different types of asthma:</p><ul> <li>Allergic asthma is caused by allergens. Allergens are substances that cause an allergic reaction. They can include <ul> <li>Dust mites</li> <li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/molds.html\">Mold</a></li> <li>Pets</li> <li>Pollen from grass, trees, and weeds</li> <li>Waste from pests such as cockroaches and mice</li> </ul> </li> <li>Nonallergic asthma is caused by triggers that are not allergens, such as <ul> <li>Breathing in cold air</li> <li>Certain medicines</li> <li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/householdproducts.html\">Household chemicals</a></li> <li>Infections such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/commoncold.html\">colds</a> and the <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/flu.html\">flu</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/airpollution.html\">Outdoor air pollution</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/secondhandsmoke.html\">Tobacco smoke</a></li> </ul> </li> <li>Exercise-induced asthma happens during physical exercise, especially when the air is dry</li> </ul> <p>Asthma triggers may be different for each child and can change over time.</p> <h3>Which children are at risk for asthma?</h3> <p>Certain factors raise the risk of asthma in children:</p><ul> <li><strong>Being exposed to secondhand smoke</strong> when their mother is pregnant with them or when they are small children</li> <li><strong>Genetics and family history.</strong> Children are more likely to have asthma if one of their parents has it, especially if it's the mother. </li> <li><strong>Race or ethnicity.</strong> Black and African Americans and Puerto Ricans are at higher risk of asthma than people of other races or ethnicities.</li> <li><strong>Having other diseases or conditions</strong> such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/obesity.html\">obesity</a> and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/allergy.html\">allergies</a></li> <li><strong>Often having viral respiratory infections</strong> as young children</li> <li><strong>Sex.</strong> In children, asthma is more common in boys. In teens, it is more common in girls.</li> </ul> <h3>What are the symptoms of asthma in children?</h3> <p>The symptoms of asthma in children include:</p><ul> <li>Chest tightness</li> <li>Coughing, especially at night or early morning</li> <li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/breathingproblems.html\">Breathing problems</a>, such as shortness of breath, rapid breathing, or gasping for air</li> <li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/fatigue.html\">Feeling tired</a></li> <li>Dark circles under the eyes</li> <li>Being irritable</li> <li>Wheezing, which causes a whistling sound when they breathe out</li> <li>Trouble eating or sucking (in infants)</li> </ul> <p>These symptoms can range from mild to severe. They may happen often or only once in a while.</p> <p>When children have an asthma attack, their symptoms get much worse. The attacks may come on gradually or suddenly. Sometimes they can be life-threatening. Warning signs of a severe attack include severe coughing, serious breathing problems, and turning very pale or blue in the face, lips and/or fingernails. If your child has those symptoms, get medical help right away.</p> <h3>How is asthma in children diagnosed?</h3> <p>It can be hard to diagnose asthma in children, especially if they are young. Asthma has similar symptoms as other childhood conditions. And some children may not have asthma symptoms very often, so it may seem like they are having respiratory infections instead.</p> <p>Your child's health care provider may use many tools to diagnose asthma:</p><ul> <li>Physical exam</li> <li>Medical history</li> <li>Chest <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/xrays.html\">x-ray</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/lung-function-tests/\">Lung function tests</a>, including spirometry, to test how well the lungs work. Younger children are usually not able to do these tests.</li> <li>Allergy <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/allergy-skin-test/\">skin</a> or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/allergy-blood-test/\">blood</a> tests, if you have a history of allergies. These tests check which allergens cause a reaction from your immune system.</li> </ul> <p>If you have a young child who cannot do lung function tests, the provider may suggest doing a trial of asthma medicines. The trial involves giving your child the medicines for several weeks to see whether the symptoms get better.</p> <h3>What are the treatments for asthma in children?</h3> <p>If your child has asthma, you will work with their health care provider to create a treatment plan. The plan will include ways to manage your child's asthma symptoms and prevent asthma attacks, such as:</p><ul> <li><strong>Strategies to avoid triggers.</strong> For example, if tobacco smoke is a trigger for your child, you should not allow anyone to smoke in your home or car.</li> <li><strong>Short-term relief medicines,</strong> also called quick-relief medicines. They help prevent symptoms or relieve symptoms during an asthma attack. They include an inhaler to have for your child at all times. It may also include other types of medicines which work quickly to help open your child's airways.</li> <li><strong>Control medicines.</strong> They work by reducing airway inflammation and preventing narrowing of the airways. Not all children will take control medicines. Whether or not your child needs them depends on how severe the asthma is and how often your child has symptoms.</li> </ul> <p>If your child has a severe attack and the short-term relief medicines do not work, get medical help right away.</p> <p>Your child's provider may adjust the treatment until the asthma symptoms are controlled.</p>",

Definition: The sulfate salt form of codeine, a naturally occurring phenanthrene alkaloid and opioid agonist with analgesic, antidiarrheal and antitussive activity. Codeine sulfate mimics the actions of opioids by binding to the opioid receptors at many sites within the central nervous system (CNS). Stimulation of the mu-subtype opioid receptor stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex and subsequently inhibits adenylate cyclase. This results in a decrease in intracellular cAMP and leads to a reduction in the release of neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline. The analgesic effect of codeine sulfate is likely due to its metabolite morphine, which induces opening of G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels and blocks the opening of N-type voltage-gated calcium channels, thereby resulting in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability.",

Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is a competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) that is formed when S-adenosylmethionine protein N-methyltransferases transfer two methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine to one of the two guanidine nitrogen groups of an arginine residue in a protein. ADMA is released when the protein is degraded and is a substrate for dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH). Free ADMA in plasma competes with the L-arginine for binding to the heme in NOS and inhibits nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. Decreased synthesis of NO inhibits vasodilation and leads to endothelial dysfunction.

However, mutualism, parasitism, and commensalism are often not discrete categories of interactions and should rather be perceived as a continuum of interaction ranging from parasitism to mutualism. In fact, the direction of a symbiotic interaction can change during the lifetime of the symbionts due to developmental changes as well as changes in the biotic/abiotic environment in which the interaction occurs.

  "C0885957_topp": "C0885957_topp | Eye care (regime/therapy). Type: Health Care Activity. Definition: <p>Your eyes are an important part of your health. Most people rely on their eyes to see and make sense of the world around them. But some <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/eyediseases.html\">eye diseases</a> can lead to <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/visionimpairmentandblindness.html\">vision loss</a>, so it is important to identify and treat eye diseases as early as possible. You should get your eyes checked as often as your health care provider recommends it, or if you have any new vision problems. And just as it is important to keep your body healthy, you also need to keep your eyes healthy.</p> <h3>Eye Care Tips</h3> <p>There are things you can do to help keep your eyes healthy and make sure you are seeing your best:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Eat a healthy, balanced diet.</strong> Your diet should include plenty or fruits and vegetables, especially deep yellow and green leafy vegetables. Eating fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and halibut can also help your eyes.</li> <li><strong>Maintain a healthy weight.</strong> Being overweight or having obesity increases your risk of developing diabetes. Having diabetes puts you at higher risk of getting <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/diabeticeyeproblems.html\">diabetic retinopathy</a> or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/glaucoma.html\">glaucoma</a>.</li> <li><strong>Get regular exercise.</strong> Exercise may help to prevent or control diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. These diseases can lead to some eye or vision problems. So if you exercise regularly, you can lower your risk of getting these eye and vision problems.</li> <li><strong>Wear sunglasses.</strong> <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/sunexposure.html\">Sun exposure</a> can damage your eyes and raise your risk of <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/cataract.html\">cataracts</a> and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/maculardegeneration.html\">age-related macular degeneration</a>. Protect your eyes by using sunglasses that block out 99 to 100% of both UV-A and UV-B radiation.</li> <li><strong>Wear protective eye wear.</strong> To prevent <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/eyeinjuries.html\">eye injuries</a>, you need eye protection when playing certain sports, working in jobs such as factory work and construction, and doing repairs or projects in your home.</li> <li><strong>Avoid smoking.</strong> Smoking increases the risk of developing age-related eye diseases such as macular degeneration and cataracts and can damage the <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/opticnervedisorders.html\">optic nerve</a>.</li> <li><strong>Know your family medical history.</strong> Some eye diseases are inherited, so it is important to find out whether anyone in your family has had them. This can help you determine if you are at higher risk of developing an eye disease.</li> <li><strong>Know your other risk factors.</strong> As you get older, you are at higher risk of developing age-related eye diseases and conditions. It is important to know you risk factors because you may be able to lower your risk by changing some behaviors.</li> <li><strong>If you wear contacts, take steps to prevent eye infections.</strong> Wash your hands well before you put in or take out your contact lenses. Also follow the instructions on how to properly clean them, and replace them when needed.</li> <li><strong>Give your eyes a rest.</strong> If you spend a lot of time using a computer, you can forget to blink your eyes and your eyes can get tired. To reduce eyestrain, try the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look away about 20 feet in front of you for 20 seconds.</li> </ul> <h3>Eye Tests and Exams</h3> <p>Everyone needs to have their eyesight tested to check for vision and eye problems. Children usually have vision screening in school or at their health care provider's office during a checkup. Adults may also get vision screenings during their checkups. But many adults need more than a vision screening. They need a comprehensive dilated eye exam.</p> <p>Getting comprehensive dilated eye exams is especially important because some eye diseases may not have warning signs. The exams are the only way to detect these diseases in their early stages, when they are easier to treat.</p> <p>The exam includes several tests:</p> <ul> <li>A visual field test to measure your side (peripheral) vision. A loss of peripheral vision may be a sign of glaucoma.</li> <li>A visual acuity test, where you read an eye chart about 20 feet away, to check on how well you see at various distances</li> <li>Tonometry, which measures your eye's interior pressure. It helps to detect glaucoma.</li> <li>Dilation, which involves getting eye drops that dilate (widen) your pupils. This allows more light to enter the eye. Your eye care provider examines your eyes using a special magnifying lens. This provides a clear view of important tissues at the back of your eye, including the <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/retinaldisorders.html\">retina</a>, macula, and optic nerve.</li> </ul> <p>If you have a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/refractiveerrors.html\">refractive error</a> and are going to need <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/eyewear.html\">glasses or contacts</a>, then you will also have a refraction test. When you have this test, you look through a device that has lenses of different strengths to help your eye care professional figure out which lenses will give you the clearest vision.</p> <p>At what age you should start getting these exams and how often you need them depends on many factors. They include your age, race, and overall health. For example, if you are African American, you are at higher risk of glaucoma and you need to start getting the exams earlier. If you have diabetes, you should get an exam every year. Check with your health care provider about if and when you need these exams.</p>",

Definition: The hydrochloride salt form of esmolol, a short, rapid-acting, selective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and with anti-arrhythmic, antihypertensive and potential analgesic activities. Upon intravenous administration, esmolol binds to and blocks the beta-1 receptor in the myocardium thereby preventing the action of epinephrine and norepinephrine. This leads to a reduction in the force and rate of cardiac contractions and thereby preventing tachycardia, arrythmias and/or hypertension. At higher doses, esmolol also blocks beta-2 receptors located in bronchial and vascular smooth muscle, thereby leading to smooth muscle relaxation. In addition, esmolol exerts a peripheral analgesic effect and intraoperative use of this agent may decrease the amount of opioid administration postoperatively. As the ester moiety in esmolol is rapidly hydrolyzed byplasma esterases, this agent has a very short half-life.

Definition: A synthetic N-acetyl derivative and prodrug of the endogenous amino acid L-cysteine, a precursor of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH), with mucolytic, antioxidant, and potential cytoprotective, cancer-preventive, and anti-inflammatory activities. Upon administration, acetylcysteine exerts its mucolytic activity by reducing disulfide bonds in mucoproteins, resulting in liquification of mucus and reducing its viscosity. It is also used for the treatment of acetaminophen overdose as it can restore the depleted GSH reserves in the hepatocytes during the process of detoxification. The antioxidant activity is attributed to the ability of GSH to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby preventing ROS-mediated cell damage, decreasing oxidative stress, protecting cells against the damaging effects of free radicals and preventing apoptosis in these cells. In addition, this may inhibit tumor cell proliferation, progression and survival, in susceptible tumor cells that rely on ROS-mediated signaling for their proliferation and malignant behavior. Under certain circumstances, acetylcysteine is able to induce apoptosis in susceptible cells, including certain tumor cells, via the intrinsic mitochondria-dependent pathway but not involving endoplasmic reticulum stress. Also, acetylcysteine may also be able to degrade Notch2, thereby preventing proliferation, migration, and invasion in Notch2-overexpressing glioblastoma cells. In addition, acetylcysteine may inhibit viral stimulation by reactive oxygen intermediates, thereby producing antiviral activity in HIV patients. Acetylcysteine also possesses anti-inflammatory activity through modulation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) pathway and the modulation of cytokine synthesis.",

It appears that the metabolism of neurofilaments is disturbed in Alzheimer's disease, as indicated by the presence of neurofilament epitopes in the neurofibrillary tangles, as well as by the severe reduction of the expression of the gene for the light neurofilament subunit of the neurofilament triplet in brains of Alzheimer's patients.

Definition: The hydrochloride salt of doxorubicin, an anthracycline antibiotic with antineoplastic activity. Doxorubicin, isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius, is the hydroxylated congener of daunorubicin. Doxorubicin intercalates between base pairs in the DNA helix, thereby preventing DNA replication and ultimately inhibiting protein synthesis. Additionally, doxorubicin inhibits topoisomerase II which results in an increased and stabilized cleavable enzyme-DNA linked complex during DNA replication and subsequently prevents the ligation of the nucleotide strand after double-strand breakage. Doxorubicin also forms oxygen free radicals resulting in cytotoxicity secondary to lipid peroxidation of cell membrane lipids; the formation of oxygen free radicals also contributes to the toxicity of the anthracycline antibiotics, namely the cardiac and cutaneous vascular effects.",

Definition: The disodium salt form of dithio-ethane sulfonate, a dimer of mesna and a disulfide bond disrupting agent (DDA), with uroprotective, nephroprotective, chemoprotective, chemosensitizing and chemo-enhancing activities. Upon administration, dimesna is able to modify cysteine on various proteins, such as the kinases EGFR, MET and ROS1, thereby disrupting extracellular disulfide bonds and modulating the activity of these proteins. This inhibits their signaling pathways and downregulates proliferative signaling in cancer cells in which these kinases are overexpressed. This may also enhance the activity of other kinase inhibitors targeting the same proteins. In the kidneys, dimesna undergoes reduction to the free thiol compound, mesna, which reacts chemically with the urotoxic ifosfamide metabolites acrolein and 4-hydroxy-ifosfamide, resulting in their detoxification. This agent also inhibits cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. In addition, dimesna reduces toxicities associated with taxanes and platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents.",

Definition: A morpholine-based inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family of proteins, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, the PI3K/BET inhibitor LY294002 specifically targets and binds to both PI3K and the acetylated lysine recognition motifs in the bromodomains of BET proteins. Inhibition of PI3K activity inhibits the PI3K/AKT kinase signaling pathway. This may result in inhibition of growth and survival for tumor cells in which the PI3K-mediated signaling pathway is overactivated. Inhibition of BET proteins prevents their interaction with acetylated histones, disrupts chromatin remodeling and inhibits the expression of oncogenic drivers that are important for cell proliferation and survival, which together may lead to an inhibition of proliferation in BET-overexpressing tumor cells. Activation of the PI3K signaling pathway is frequently associated with tumorigenesis. BET proteins, comprised of BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT, are transcriptional regulators and play an important role during development and cellular growth. In tumor cells, BET proteins play a key role in the regulation of oncogene transcription and tumor cell proliferation.",
