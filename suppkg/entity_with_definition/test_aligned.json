  "C0123047_orch": "C0123047_orch | ibudilast. Type: Organic Chemical, Pharmacologic Substance. Definition: An orally bioavailable inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE), mainly PDE-3, -4, -10, and -11, with anti-(neuro)inflammatory, vasorelaxant, bronchodilator, analgesic, neuroprotective and potential anti-tumor activities. Ibudilast (IBD) is able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Upon administration, IBD exerts its potential anti-tumor activity against glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells by inhibiting PDE-4 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), which results in a decrease in MIF, its receptor CD74, and AKT expression, and attenuates the immunosuppressive properties of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and reduces T-regulatory cells (Tregs). This causes GBM cell apoptosis and inhibits GBM cell proliferation. In addition, IBD reduces, through its inhibitory effect on various PDEs, the production of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL- 1beta, leukotriene B4, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a). IBD also upregulates the anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10), and promotes the production of neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4). It also blocks toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), inhibits nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and reduces the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). It also prevents platelet aggregation, causes cerebral vasodilation, bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, and improves cerebral blood flow. In addition, IBD attenuates the PDE-mediated activation of glial cells and abrogates PDE-mediated neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. MIF is secreted by cancer stem cells (CSCs) and is highly expressed within GBM and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation. Co-expression of MIF and CD74 in GBM is associated with poor patient survival.",

Definition: A phenolic phytochemical naturally occurring in extra virgin olive oil, with potential antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cancer preventive activities. Although the mechanisms of action through which hydroxytyrosol exerts its effects have yet to be fully determined, this agent affects the expression of various components of the inflammatory response, possibly through the modulation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) pathway. The effects include the modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as the inhibition of interleukin-1alpha (IL-1a), IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a); increased secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10; inhibition of the production of certain chemokines, such as C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10/IP-10), C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2/MCP-1), and macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta (CCL4/MIP-1b); and inhibition of the expression of the enzymes inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS/NOS2) and prostaglandin E2 synthase (PGES), which prevent the production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E (PGE2), respectively. In addition, hydroxytyrosol is able to regulate the expression of other genes involved in the regulation of tumor cell proliferation, such as extracellular signal-regulated and cyclin-dependent kinases. Also, hydroxytyrosol scavenges free radicals and prevents oxidative DNA damage. This induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation in susceptible cancer cells.",

Definition: An interaction between two organisms living together in more or less intimate association. The term host is usually used for the larger (macro) of the two members of a symbiosis. The smaller (micro) member is called the symbiont organism. Microscopic symbionts are often referred to as endosymbionts. The various forms of symbiosis include parasitism, in which the association is disadvantageous or destructive to one of the organisms; mutualism, in which the association is advantageous, or often necessary to one or both and not harmful to either; and commensalism, in which one member of the association benefits while the other is not affected. However, mutualism, parasitism, and commensalism are often not discrete categories of interactions and should rather be perceived as a continuum of interaction ranging from parasitism to mutualism. In fact, the direction of a symbiotic interaction can change during the lifetime of the symbionts due to developmental changes as well as changes in the biotic/abiotic environment in which the interaction occurs.

  "C1328202_phsu": "C1328202_phsu | gallium maltolate. Type: Organic Chemical, Pharmacologic Substance. Definition: An orally bioavailable form of the element gallium (Ga) composed of a trivalent gallium cation (Ga3+) coordinated to three maltolate ligands, with anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, antineoplastic, analgesic, antiresorptive and antibacterial activities. Upon administration of gallium maltolate, Ga3+, which is structurally similar to the ferric ion (Fe3+), competes with and replaces Fe3+ in many vital Fe 3+-mediated biological reactions.. Unlike Fe3+, Ga3+ cannot be reduced, cannot participate in redox reactions and cannot mimic Fe3+ functions. In rapidly proliferating cells, such as cancer cells, high amounts of iron are needed for DNA synthesis. The incorporation of Ga3+ inactivates the Fe3+-dependent enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RR), an enzyme essential for DNA synthesis, leading to an inhibition of DNA synthesis and induction of cell death in rapidly proliferating cells. Gallium similarly reduces bacterial cell growth. In addition, Ga3+ is able to suppress inflammation through the down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cells and the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Gallium also exerts analgesic effects due to the inhibition of Fe3+-dependent enzymes involved in inflammation and may interfere with the activity of certain metalloproteinases and neuropeptides that are implicated in pain. Also, gallium is able to inhibit bone resorption by osteoclasts, may inhibit metastasis to bone and may prevent the destruction of bone by tumors.",

Definition: Nenádorové onemocnění, které vzniká následkem přesunu normální žlázové výstelky děložní dutiny (endometria) do vrstvy děložní svaloviny (myometria). Žlázová tkáň postupně vrůstá stále hlouběji do svalové vrstvy, u které, na rozdíl od endometria, nedochází k typickým cyklickým změnám v rámci menstruačního cyklu. Příčina takovéhoto chování endometria není známa, uvažuje se o vlivu estrogenu a mechanické příčině (opakované porody) ve smyslu poškození bazální membrány jako fyziologické bariéry mezi sliznicí a svalovinou dělohy. Adenomyóza postihuje hlavně ženy v plodném věku starší 30 let, které vícekrát rodily. Často se vyskytuje v kombinaci s endometriózou a leimyomem dělohy. (cit.

Definition: A synthetic N-acetyl derivative and prodrug of the endogenous amino acid L-cysteine, a precursor of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH), with mucolytic, antioxidant, and potential cytoprotective, cancer-preventive, and anti-inflammatory activities. Upon administration, acetylcysteine exerts its mucolytic activity by reducing disulfide bonds in mucoproteins, resulting in liquification of mucus and reducing its viscosity. It is also used for the treatment of acetaminophen overdose as it can restore the depleted GSH reserves in the hepatocytes during the process of detoxification. The antioxidant activity is attributed to the ability of GSH to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby preventing ROS-mediated cell damage, decreasing oxidative stress, protecting cells against the damaging effects of free radicals and preventing apoptosis in these cells. In addition, this may inhibit tumor cell proliferation, progression and survival, in susceptible tumor cells that rely on ROS-mediated signaling for their proliferation and malignant behavior. Under certain circumstances, acetylcysteine is able to induce apoptosis in susceptible cells, including certain tumor cells, via the intrinsic mitochondria-dependent pathway but not involving endoplasmic reticulum stress. Also, acetylcysteine may also be able to degrade Notch2, thereby preventing proliferation, migration, and invasion in Notch2-overexpressing glioblastoma cells. In addition, acetylcysteine may inhibit viral stimulation by reactive oxygen intermediates, thereby producing antiviral activity in HIV patients. Acetylcysteine also possesses anti-inflammatory activity through modulation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) pathway and the modulation of cytokine synthesis.",

Metformin inhibits complex I (NADPH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, thereby increasing the cellular AMP to ATP ratio and leading to activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and regulating AMPK-mediated transcription of target genes. This eventually prevents hepatic gluconeogenesis, enhances insulin sensitivity and fatty acid oxidation and ultimately leads to a decrease in glucose levels. Metformin may exert antineoplastic effects through AMPK-mediated or AMPK-independent inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is up-regulated in many cancer tissues.

Definition: A morpholine-based inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family of proteins, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, the PI3K/BET inhibitor LY294002 specifically targets and binds to both PI3K and the acetylated lysine recognition motifs in the bromodomains of BET proteins. Inhibition of PI3K activity inhibits the PI3K/AKT kinase signaling pathway. This may result in inhibition of growth and survival for tumor cells in which the PI3K-mediated signaling pathway is overactivated. Inhibition of BET proteins prevents their interaction with acetylated histones, disrupts chromatin remodeling and inhibits the expression of oncogenic drivers that are important for cell proliferation and survival, which together may lead to an inhibition of proliferation in BET-overexpressing tumor cells. Activation of the PI3K signaling pathway is frequently associated with tumorigenesis. BET proteins, comprised of BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT, are transcriptional regulators and play an important role during development and cellular growth. In tumor cells, BET proteins play a key role in the regulation of oncogene transcription and tumor cell proliferation.",

ERa36 modulator icaritin selectively binds to a novel variant of estrogen receptor alpha, a36, and mediates a membrane-initiated \"nongenomic\" signaling pathway, which is linked to activate signaling pathways like the MAPK/ERK and the PI3K/Akt pathways. This agent induces cell cycle arrest at G1, or G2/M arrest depending upon the dose. Consistently with G1 arrest, icaritin increases protein expressions of pRb, p27(Kip1) and p16(Ink4a), while decreasing phosphorylated pRb, Cyclin D1 and CDK4. 40% of ER-negative breast cancer tumors express high levels of ERa36, and this subset of patients is less likely to benefit from tamoxifen treatment compared with those with ERa66-positive/ERa36-negative tumors.",

  "C0264408_dsyn": "C0264408_dsyn | Childhood asthma. Type: Disease or Syndrome. Definition: <h3>What is asthma? </h3> <p><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/asthma.html\">Asthma</a> is a chronic (long-term) lung disease. It affects your airways, the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. When you have asthma, your airways can become inflamed and narrowed. This can cause wheezing, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/cough.html\">coughing</a>, and tightness in your chest. When these symptoms get worse than usual, it is called an asthma attack or flare-up.</p> <h3>How does asthma affect children? </h3> <p>Asthma often starts during childhood, usually before age 5. Many children have asthma - it is the most common chronic disease of childhood. It can cause children to miss school and end up in the hospital. But treatments can help manage asthma.</p> <h3>What causes asthma in children?</h3> <p>The exact cause of asthma is unknown. Genetics and environment likely play a role in which children get asthma.</p> <p>An asthma attack can happen when your child is exposed to an asthma trigger. An asthma trigger is something that can set off or worsen asthma symptoms. Different triggers can cause different types of asthma:</p><ul> <li>Allergic asthma is caused by allergens. Allergens are substances that cause an allergic reaction. They can include <ul> <li>Dust mites</li> <li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/molds.html\">Mold</a></li> <li>Pets</li> <li>Pollen from grass, trees, and weeds</li> <li>Waste from pests such as cockroaches and mice</li> </ul> </li> <li>Nonallergic asthma is caused by triggers that are not allergens, such as <ul> <li>Breathing in cold air</li> <li>Certain medicines</li> <li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/householdproducts.html\">Household chemicals</a></li> <li>Infections such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/commoncold.html\">colds</a> and the <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/flu.html\">flu</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/airpollution.html\">Outdoor air pollution</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/secondhandsmoke.html\">Tobacco smoke</a></li> </ul> </li> <li>Exercise-induced asthma happens during physical exercise, especially when the air is dry</li> </ul> <p>Asthma triggers may be different for each child and can change over time.</p> <h3>Which children are at risk for asthma?</h3> <p>Certain factors raise the risk of asthma in children:</p><ul> <li><strong>Being exposed to secondhand smoke</strong> when their mother is pregnant with them or when they are small children</li> <li><strong>Genetics and family history.</strong> Children are more likely to have asthma if one of their parents has it, especially if it's the mother. </li> <li><strong>Race or ethnicity.</strong> Black and African Americans and Puerto Ricans are at higher risk of asthma than people of other races or ethnicities.</li> <li><strong>Having other diseases or conditions</strong> such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/obesity.html\">obesity</a> and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/allergy.html\">allergies</a></li> <li><strong>Often having viral respiratory infections</strong> as young children</li> <li><strong>Sex.</strong> In children, asthma is more common in boys. In teens, it is more common in girls.</li> </ul> <h3>What are the symptoms of asthma in children?</h3> <p>The symptoms of asthma in children include:</p><ul> <li>Chest tightness</li> <li>Coughing, especially at night or early morning</li> <li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/breathingproblems.html\">Breathing problems</a>, such as shortness of breath, rapid breathing, or gasping for air</li> <li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/fatigue.html\">Feeling tired</a></li> <li>Dark circles under the eyes</li> <li>Being irritable</li> <li>Wheezing, which causes a whistling sound when they breathe out</li> <li>Trouble eating or sucking (in infants)</li> </ul> <p>These symptoms can range from mild to severe. They may happen often or only once in a while.</p> <p>When children have an asthma attack, their symptoms get much worse. The attacks may come on gradually or suddenly. Sometimes they can be life-threatening. Warning signs of a severe attack include severe coughing, serious breathing problems, and turning very pale or blue in the face, lips and/or fingernails. If your child has those symptoms, get medical help right away.</p> <h3>How is asthma in children diagnosed?</h3> <p>It can be hard to diagnose asthma in children, especially if they are young. Asthma has similar symptoms as other childhood conditions. And some children may not have asthma symptoms very often, so it may seem like they are having respiratory infections instead.</p> <p>Your child's health care provider may use many tools to diagnose asthma:</p><ul> <li>Physical exam</li> <li>Medical history</li> <li>Chest <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/xrays.html\">x-ray</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/lung-function-tests/\">Lung function tests</a>, including spirometry, to test how well the lungs work. Younger children are usually not able to do these tests.</li> <li>Allergy <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/allergy-skin-test/\">skin</a> or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/allergy-blood-test/\">blood</a> tests, if you have a history of allergies. These tests check which allergens cause a reaction from your immune system.</li> </ul> <p>If you have a young child who cannot do lung function tests, the provider may suggest doing a trial of asthma medicines. The trial involves giving your child the medicines for several weeks to see whether the symptoms get better.</p> <h3>What are the treatments for asthma in children?</h3> <p>If your child has asthma, you will work with their health care provider to create a treatment plan. The plan will include ways to manage your child's asthma symptoms and prevent asthma attacks, such as:</p><ul> <li><strong>Strategies to avoid triggers.</strong> For example, if tobacco smoke is a trigger for your child, you should not allow anyone to smoke in your home or car.</li> <li><strong>Short-term relief medicines,</strong> also called quick-relief medicines. They help prevent symptoms or relieve symptoms during an asthma attack. They include an inhaler to have for your child at all times. It may also include other types of medicines which work quickly to help open your child's airways.</li> <li><strong>Control medicines.</strong> They work by reducing airway inflammation and preventing narrowing of the airways. Not all children will take control medicines. Whether or not your child needs them depends on how severe the asthma is and how often your child has symptoms.</li> </ul> <p>If your child has a severe attack and the short-term relief medicines do not work, get medical help right away.</p> <p>Your child's provider may adjust the treatment until the asthma symptoms are controlled.</p>",

Definition: A synthetic, highly-flammable, volatile, colorless liquid that is soluble in water and miscible with many organic solvents. Propylene oxide is used primarily as a chemical intermediate in the production of polyethers and propylene glycol. It is also used as a pesticide and a fumigant for the sterilization of packaged foods and plastic medical instruments. Acute inhalation exposure to vapors of this compound can result in respiratory tract irritation, coughing, difficulty in breathing (dyspnea) and buildup of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) that can possibly lead to pneumonia. Inhale high concentrations of the vapors for short time periods may cause headache, motor weakness, incoordination, ataxia and coma. Contact with propylene oxide can irritate the eyes and skin. It is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. (NCI05)",

Definition: An orally bioavailable, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, with potential central nervous system (CNS) stimulating, neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic activities. Upon administration, ifenprodil targets, binds to and inhibits glutamanergic NMDA receptors (NMDARs), specifically the glycine-binding NMDA receptor subunit 1 (GluN1) and 2 (glutamate-binding NMDA receptor subunit 2; NMDA-type subunit 2B; GluN2B), thereby preventing NMDAR signaling. This inhibits neuronal excitotoxicity, and thereby potentially enhancing cognitive function. Additionally, ifenprodil inhibits G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels, and interacts with alpha1 adrenergic, serotonin, and activates sigma receptors. Ifenprodil exerts its anti-inflammatory effect through its effect on NMDA and possibly sigma-1 receptors. Although the exact mechanism has not fully been elucidated, this agent reduces the infiltration of neutrophils and T-cells into the lungs and prevents the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This may result in the reduction of the lung inflammatory response, inhibit fibrosis in the lungs and may reduce the severity of cough. NMDA receptors are multimeric ionotropic glutamate receptors composed of four subunits and are expressed on various cells and organs, such as in the brain, lungs, and on T-cells and neutrophils.",

Their major protein component is APOLIPOPROTEIN A-I. HDL also shuttle APOLIPOPROTEINS C and APOLIPOPROTEINS E to and from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins during their catabolism. HDL plasma level has been inversely correlated with the risk of cardiovascular diseases.",

Agonist activity at 5-HT1A postsynaptic receptors may enhance the release of dopamine and other monoamines. Combined with 5-HT2A antagonism, flibanserin boosts levels of dopamine in the mesocortical area of the prefrontal cortex and produces a net increase of norepinephrine selectively in the prefrontal cortex through disinhibition of locus coeruleus noradrenergic neurons. In addition, flibanserin reduces concentrations of serotonin in the prefrontal cortex with chronic administration.

Definition: A morpholine-based inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family of proteins, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, the PI3K/BET inhibitor LY294002 specifically targets and binds to both PI3K and the acetylated lysine recognition motifs in the bromodomains of BET proteins. Inhibition of PI3K activity inhibits the PI3K/AKT kinase signaling pathway. This may result in inhibition of growth and survival for tumor cells in which the PI3K-mediated signaling pathway is overactivated. Inhibition of BET proteins prevents their interaction with acetylated histones, disrupts chromatin remodeling and inhibits the expression of oncogenic drivers that are important for cell proliferation and survival, which together may lead to an inhibition of proliferation in BET-overexpressing tumor cells. Activation of the PI3K signaling pathway is frequently associated with tumorigenesis. BET proteins, comprised of BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT, are transcriptional regulators and play an important role during development and cellular growth. In tumor cells, BET proteins play a key role in the regulation of oncogene transcription and tumor cell proliferation.",

ADMA is released when the protein is degraded and is a substrate for dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH). Free ADMA in plasma competes with the L-arginine for binding to the heme in NOS and inhibits nitric oxide (NO) synthesis.

  "C0001956_mobd": "C0001956_mobd | Alcohol Use Disorder. Type: Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction. Definition: <h3>What is alcohol use disorder (AUD)?</h3> <p>For most adults, moderate <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/alcohol.html\">alcohol</a> use is probably not harmful. However, about 18 million adult Americans have an alcohol use disorder (AUD). This means that their drinking causes distress and harm. AUD can range from mild to severe, depending on the symptoms. Severe AUD is sometimes called alcoholism or alcohol dependence.</p> <p>AUD is a disease that causes:</p><ul> <li>Craving - a strong need to drink</li> <li>Loss of control - not being able to stop drinking once you've started</li> <li>Negative emotional state - feeling anxious and irritable when you are not drinking</li> </ul> <h3>What is binge drinking?</h3> <p>Binge drinking is drinking so much at once that your blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level is 0.08% or more. For a man, this usually happens after having 5 or more drinks within a few hours. For a woman, it is after about 4 or more drinks within a few hours. Not everyone who binge drinks has an AUD, but they are at higher risk for getting one.</p> <h3>What are the dangers of too much alcohol?</h3> <p>Too much alcohol is dangerous. Heavy drinking can increase the risk of certain cancers. It may lead to <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/liverdiseases.html\">liver diseases</a>, such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/fattyliverdisease.html\">fatty liver disease</a> and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/cirrhosis.html\">cirrhosis</a>. It can also cause damage to the brain and other organs. Drinking during pregnancy can <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/fetalalcoholspectrumdisorders.html\">harm your baby</a>. Alcohol also increases the risk of death from car crashes, injuries, homicide, and suicide.</p> <h3>How do I know if I have an alcohol use disorder (AUD)?</h3> <p>You may have an AUD if you can answer yes to two or more of these questions:</p> <p>In the past year, have you:</p><ul> <li>Ended up drinking more or for a longer time than you had planned to?</li> <li>Wanted to cut down or stop drinking, or tried to, but couldn't?</li> <li>Spent a lot of your time drinking or recovering from drinking?</li> <li>Felt a strong need to drink?</li> <li>Found that drinking - or being sick from drinking - often interfered with your family life, job, or school?</li> <li>Kept drinking even though it was causing trouble with your family or friends?</li> <li>Given up or cut back on activities that you enjoyed just so you could drink?</li> <li>Gotten into dangerous situations while drinking or after drinking? Some examples are driving drunk and having unsafe sex.</li> <li>Kept drinking even though it was making you feel depressed or anxious? Or when it was adding to another health problem?</li> <li>Had to drink more and more to feel the effects of the alcohol?</li> <li>Had withdrawal symptoms when the alcohol was wearing off? They include trouble sleeping, shakiness, irritability, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/anxiety.html\">anxiety</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/depression.html\">depression</a>, restlessness, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/nauseaandvomiting.html\">nausea</a>, and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/sweat.html\">sweating</a>. In severe cases, you could have a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/fever.html\">fever</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/seizures.html\">seizures</a>, or hallucinations.</li> </ul> <p>If you have any of these symptoms, your drinking may already be a cause for concern. The more symptoms you have, the more serious the problem is.</p> <h3>What should I do if I think that I might have an alcohol use disorder (AUD)?</h3> <p>If you think you might have an AUD, see your health care provider for an evaluation. Your provider can help make a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/alcoholusedisorderaudtreatment.html\">treatment plan</a>, prescribe medicines, and if needed, give you treatment referrals.</p> <p class=\"\">NIH: National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</p>",

Definition: The hydrochloride salt form of esmolol, a short, rapid-acting, selective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and with anti-arrhythmic, antihypertensive and potential analgesic activities. Upon intravenous administration, esmolol binds to and blocks the beta-1 receptor in the myocardium thereby preventing the action of epinephrine and norepinephrine. This leads to a reduction in the force and rate of cardiac contractions and thereby preventing tachycardia, arrythmias and/or hypertension. At higher doses, esmolol also blocks beta-2 receptors located in bronchial and vascular smooth muscle, thereby leading to smooth muscle relaxation. In addition, esmolol exerts a peripheral analgesic effect and intraoperative use of this agent may decrease the amount of opioid administration postoperatively. As the ester moiety in esmolol is rapidly hydrolyzed byplasma esterases, this agent has a very short half-life.
